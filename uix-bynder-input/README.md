# UI Extensions тип Bynder

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

This example integrates GraphCMS with Bynder. It leverages Bynder's Compact View v2 component to browse assets from Bynder and use these within GraphCMS content entries.

## How to Use

Deploy the code to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or run locally, and install on GraphCMS as a UI extension using the URL to your index page as the URL for your extension, and run the compatibility test.

You can get started with our hosted example, but you should deploy and maintain this on your own host: `https://graphcms-uix-bynder.vercel.app/`

### Example Config Settings

When configuring the extension you'll be asked for the following:

| Name                    | Type    | Description                                                     | Example                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Default Domain          | String  | Your Bynder portal url                                          | `https://<your-domain>.bynder.com/`       |
| Default domain editable | Boolean | Should users be able to change the default domain?              |                                           |
| Available asset types   | String  | Determines which asset types your users will be able to select. | `["image", "audio", "video", "document"]` |
